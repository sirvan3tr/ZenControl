# ZenControl
Helps productivity by encrypting files and programs and only decrypt after a certain time of the day. I have set this time to 1900.

Improvements needed:
You can cheat it by chaning system clock and so on
At the moment one has to add files to the local, files.db, database by having another programme add it for you.


To Encrypt:
./ZenControl encrypt

To decrypt:
./ZenControl decrypt


Database:
id, filename, filedir, status

ensure the forward or backward slash is included at the end of filedir

Thanks
